    //! %Forward rate agreement (FRA) class
    /*! 1. Unlike the forward contract conventions on carryable
           financial assets (stocks, bonds, commodities), the
           valueDate for a FRA is taken to be the day when the forward
           loan or deposit begins and when full settlement takes place
           (based on the NPV of the contract on that date).
           maturityDate is the date when the forward loan or deposit
           ends. In fact, the FRA settles and expires on the
           valueDate, not on the (later) maturityDate. It follows that
           (maturityDate - valueDate) is the tenor/term of the
           underlying loan or deposit

        2. Choose position type = Long for an "FRA purchase" (future
           long loan, short deposit [borrower])

        3. Choose position type = Short for an "FRA sale" (future short
           loan, long deposit [lender])

        4. If strike is given in the constructor, can calculate the NPV
           of the contract via NPV().

        5. If forward rate is desired/unknown, it can be obtained via
           forwardRate(). In this case, the strike variable in the
           constructor is irrelevant and will be ignored.

        <b>Example: </b>
        \link FRA.cpp
        valuation of a forward-rate agreement
        \endlink

        \todo Add preconditions and tests

        \todo Should put an instance of ForwardRateAgreement in the
              FraRateHelper to ensure consistency with the piecewise
              yield curve.

        \todo Differentiate between BBA (British)/AFB (French)
              [assumed here] and ABA (Australian) banker conventions
              in the calculations.

        \warning This class still needs to be rigorously tested
